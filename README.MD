# What is in my code
This code is a simple python function that checks if a student is in a given school.
The function takes two arguments, a student and a school, and returns True if the student is in the school, and False otherwise.

The school is given as a list of strings, where each string is the name of a student.

For example, if you have a school `["Alice", "Bob", "Carol"]`, then the function will return True if you check if "Alice" is in the school, and False if you check if "David" is in the school.

The function is defined in the file `is_in_school.py`, and can be imported and used like this:

Here are the steps to run the code:
1. Clone the repository using `git clone git@github.com:z3z3z3/PLPBASICGITASSIGNMENT.git`
2. Change into the directory using `cd PLPBASICGITASSIGNMENT`
3. Run the code using `python is_in_school.py`
